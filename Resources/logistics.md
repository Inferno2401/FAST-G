## C++

* For OOP, roughly sections 13 and 14 of [this](https://www.learncpp.com) (You don't need everything obviously, can learn it along the way)
* For better understanding C++ syntax and functionalities: [C++ Playlist by Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18c3MTX0PK0&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb) (can watch along the way. Also contains good coding practices for C++)

## Git
* For pull requests, forks etc: (https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests)
