# (Theory) Resources for Graph Theory

## Week 1

Based on your preference, you may either choose to watch the video series or read the book (or both):

- Video Series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zpSs845wf8&list=PLBF3763AF2E1C572F&index=24 : Video lectures by Dr. Naveen Garg (also recommended in CS213) which gives great introduction about various Data Structures and related Algorithms along with some ideas on how to implement those. For week 1, we will be making the base Graph class, and hence you will be expected to finish atleast lectures 24 and 25. 
- Reading material: Algorithm Design by Jon Klienberg and Eva Tardos (can be found online). Great introductory book for algorithms, and will probably be our primary reference book for implementing algorithms. For Week 1, start reading chapter 3: Graphs: until and including section 3.3.

**Note** You may come across some unfamiliar terms along the way, since graphs is ideally not the first data structure one should be implementing, but you are expected to Google them and explore yourself. As we progress, you will have a better understanding of various data structures :)

For people interested in theoratical aspects of Graph Theory, we suggest reading Introduction to Graph Theory by Douglas West once you are done (however it will not focus much on implementing algorithms).
