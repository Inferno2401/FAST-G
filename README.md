# FAST-G
This library contains implementations of various Graph Optimization and Search algorithms in C++. This project is under the Seasons of Code Initiative by the Web n Coding Club, IIT Bombay.

# Graph.hpp
All the relevant code regarding the Graph base class and the algorithms that were taught under this SoC is contained inside this header file. Up till now, I have implemented Breadth-First-Search (BFS), Depth-First-Search (DJS), Dijisktra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm and the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.
