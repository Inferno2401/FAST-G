# FAST-G
This library contains implementations of various Graph Optimization and Search algorithms in C++. This project is under the Seasons of Code Initiative by the Web n Coding Club, IIT Bombay.

# Logistics
The 13 mentees involved with the project will be divided amongst three teams. This repository will have branches for each team. Team members will issue Pull Requests to the branch corresponding to their team, the PR will be merged into the branch after mentor review. Feel free to interact (or to not interact) with members of your own team as well as those of other teams, the teams are just so that it becomes easier for us to track progress (would've been much harder to track individuals). In the next 3 days, please try to gain familiarity with Git and C++ OOP if you aren't familiar already. Resources will be shared in the Resources folder.

# Week 1-2 Tasks

In the first half week, you will be assigned some basic reading to get familiar with Graph terminology. Then in the next 7-8 days, we will come to basic traversal algorithms like BFS, DFS. Ideally in this week, you should get some idea about Git pull requests and C++ OOP as well. The main task for this week will be to design a robust Graph Base Class, and implement traversal algorithms as features in the class.

# Week 3 Tasks (starting 22-05-23)

Implement any MST algorithm, study a bit of LP, and wrap up week 1,2.

# Week 4 Onwards

Read about network flow from Kleinberg and Tardos, implement various algorithms for solving the network flow problem, analyse complexity and strong-polynomialness. (flexible)
